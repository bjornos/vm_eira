My own virtual CPU. Just for Fun.


A hobby project in C which implements a virtual machine with very loose specifications.
The framwork is currently moving towards a RISC-inspired little endian story with a 64kb
memory address limit.
Please note that current implementation relies on ANSI escape sequences for "screen output".
